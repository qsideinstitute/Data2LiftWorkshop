# Exploring Foster Youth Data Workshop

Welcome to the Exploring Foster Youth Data Workshop! This workshop is designed to guide you through the process of analyzing individual-level foster youth data, focusing on understanding the demographics and state-specific variations in foster care support. This workshop is available for both R and Python users.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin the workshop, you need to:

1. **Request Access to the Data:**
   - Open the PDF file `LastName FirstName 2024-03-13.pdf` in the `RawData` folder.
   - Follow the instructions at the top of the PDF to request access to the individual-level foster data from the National Data Archive on Child Abuse and Neglect (NDACAN). Please note that this process can take several days.

2. **Prepare the Data:**
   - Once you have access, download and unzip the data folder.
   - Move the unzipped folder to `RawData/SensitiveData` in your workshop directory.

3. **Install Required Software and Packages:**

   For R Users:
   - Download and install R from [The Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN)](https://cran.r-project.org/).
   - Download and install RStudio from the [RStudio download page](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/).

   For Python Users:
   - Download and install Python from the [Python.org downloads page](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
   - Install Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab:
     ```

     ```
   - Install required Python packages:
     ```
     pip install pandas numpy seaborn matplotlib
     ```

## Working Through the Workshop

1. **Open Your Coding Environment:**
   - For R Users: Launch RStudio and open the R Markdown file `ExploringFosterYouthData.Rmd`.
   - For Python Users: Launch Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab and open the notebook file `ExploringFosterYouthData.ipynb`.

2. **Work Through the Workshop:**
   - Follow the instructions and complete the exercises in the file.
   - Execute the code chunks or cells to perform the analyses and view the results.
   - Engage with the questions throughout the workshop to deepen your understanding of the data and the analysis techniques.

## Conclusion

Congratulations on completing the Exploring Foster Youth Data Workshop! We hope this experience has provided you with the confidence to continue working with and analyzing this foster care dataset.
